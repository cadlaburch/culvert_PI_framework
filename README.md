# Culverts_PI Paper Repo

Who prioritizes what? A cross jurisdictional comparative analysis of salmon fish passage strategies in Western Washington


## Repository Structure

/code/: Markdown files and script to explore fish barrier culverts. The scripts in /code/ transform the files in /data/ into the files in /output/.

/data/: Raw data inputs. 

/docs/: Files for report hosting here. Please do not edit as these files support the webpages.

/output/: Objects (figures, maps, intermediate datasets, etc.) generated by scripts in /code/.


## Scripts
### /code/Figure1.R 

Figure 1.Â  Map of study area showing the case area within the state of Washington. Each PI
geography is shown within the case area. Shading was used to denote PIs that overlap
geographically. Regions where no PI was located are shown as an unlabeled aggregated land
mass. WDFW and WSDOT are not shown because their geographies span the entire case area.

### /code/Figure2.R

Figure 2. Histograms of the prioritization index (PI) scores for barrier culverts. The mean and
median are displayed as a solid and dashed vertical line respectively. The IQR is shown as a
shaded region. The histograms are ordered by sample size (n). All PIs were normalized to 100 as
the maximum PI score. The scale of the y axis is determined by the maximum individual score
frequency for each entity.

### /code/Figure3.R
Figure 3. Bar graphs comparing the number of shared metrics and the scoring weight shown as a
percentage. All PIs are included in Panel A and B and only the linear PIs are included in Panel C.
Panel A shows the percent of shared metrics for each PI. Besides the PI entity name, in
parenthesis, is the number of shared metrics/number of total metrics. Panel B shows the percent
of shared metrics within each category of metric for all PIs studied. Besides the name of the
category, in parenthesis, is the number of shared metrics/number of total metrics. Panel C shows
the percent scoring weight of metric categories for each linear PI.

### /code/Figure4and5.R

Figure 4. The impact of habitat gain for culverts of different cost categories on PI scores
calculated with the WDFW method. The solid horizontal line shows the WDFW median PI
score. Dashed lines show where the different cost scenarios intersect with the median PI score.

Figure 5. The impact of habitat gain for culverts of different ESA listing categories on PI scores
calculated with the WDFW method. Species with ESA listed runs within the case area were
modeled separately for ESA status with a solid line. The dashed line indicates possible scores for
ESA listings that do not exist within the case area. Species were organized from the highest PI to
lowest to demonstrate overall prioritization weight by species.
