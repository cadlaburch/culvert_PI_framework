These data are collected under the auspices of the Fish Passage Barrier and Surface Water Diversion Screening Assessment and Prioritization Manual (WDFW, 2000, updated 2009). This manual is available in pdf format at http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/pub.php?id=00061. The data are statewide in scope but do not represent a complete and comprehensive inventory of all state waters. Numerous fish passage barrier inventories are being conducted across the state and the working data set is updated when new information becomes available. This distribution product is updated approximately every three months.

These data are provided for your use only - please do not redistribute them. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) makes no guarantee concerning the data's content, accuracy, completeness, or the results obtained from queries or use of the data, including the underlying base maps. These data are not an attempt to provide you with an official agency response as to the impacts of your project on fish and wildlife. WDFW makes no warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, no representation as to the quality of any data, and assumes no liability for the data represented here. The fish and wildlife data do not represent exhaustive inventories, but are compilations of knowledge from field biologists that are updated periodically as knowledge improves. It is important to note that habitats or species may occur on the ground in areas not currently known to WDFW biologists, or in areas for which comprehensive surveys have not been conducted. Site specific surveys are frequently necessary to rule out the presence of priority habitats or species. When conducting projects or planning for fish and wildlife, please consider using additional information gathered from field investigations and consultations with WDFW or other professional biologists. For WDFW assistance on a specific project, contact the regional WDFW office at http://wdfw.wa.gov/about/regions/.
